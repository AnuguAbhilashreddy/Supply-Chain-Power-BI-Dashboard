# 📦 Supply Chain Power BI Dashboard 

## 🧠 Project Overview

**AtliQ Mart(Imaginary Company)** is a Gujarat-based FMCG manufacturing company operating in three major cities — Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. As the company plans to expand into other Tier-1 cities, it faces a pressing issue:

Some key customers are **not renewing their annual contracts** due to repeated **delivery service failures** — either deliveries are **late**, **incomplete**, or both.

This project aims to uncover those pain points using data-driven insights from Power BI.

## 🎯 Objective

To design a Power BI dashboard that helps AtliQ Mart:
- Track delivery KPIs for each customer
- Compare service performance vs targets
- Identify cities, categories, or customers causing fulfillment issues
- Take action before expanding into new markets

| 📏 **Line Fill Rate (LiFR)** | % of order lines fulfilled                  |

## 📑 Dashboard Structure (4 Pages)

The dashboard is organized into 4 pages for focused analysis:

1. **Orders Overview** – Volume of orders by city, customer, and product  
2. **Service Level Analysis** – KPI performance vs targets  
3. **Delay Analysis** – Delayed orders and average delay by segment  
4. **Order Lines Analysis** – Visual trends of KPIs over 6 months

Each page supports filtering and drill-through for deep analysis.
